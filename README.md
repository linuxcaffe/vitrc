# vitrc

vit (https://tasktools.org/projects/vit.html) (Visual Interactive Taskwarrior) is a lightweight, curses-based front end for Taskwarrior that provides a convenient way to quickly navigate and process tasks. The program is highly configurable by editing ~/.vitrc file, however, it does not come with any default entries. (?) This repo is a copy of my .vitrc, which has been fully "tricked out" to expose as many taskwarrior features as possible, and laid out (imho) in a sane, easy to remember/ discover way.

If you are using tasnkwarrior with vit, and you are curious about how the keybinding might be configured, then I encourage you to (back up your current config file and) try out/ have a good look at this example vit config file.

If you like it or if you don't, or if you have suggestions, feel free to comment, file an issue, and/or make a pull-request.
